Compile Instructions:
-Open with Qt and build the project

-NOTE: There are a lot of warnings - all of these are for unused 
	parameters/variables. We are setting these up for future use
	
-NOTE2: Since we are submitting source code and not a compiled project where
	we would have more control over where support files are store on the 
	machine	we have tried our best to create relative file paths back to
	files in our projects source folder.
	If these relative paths give you issues try setting them to static
	paths.
	File paths can be found in:
	loginwindow.cpp - lines 14-16
	storage.cpp - lines 14-16
