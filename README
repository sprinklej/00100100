cuPID - Carleton University Project Partner IDentifier

Description:
	A system to match students into teams based on qualifications that
	the students fill out.

Created By:
	Darcy Bottomley
	Ian Smith
	Joel Sprinkle
	Matthew Wong

Tested with:
	ubuntu 14.04 LTS
	Qt Creator 3.0.1
	Sqlite3
##########################################################################

Compile Instructions:
-Open with Qt and build the project
	
-NOTE:  Since we are submitting source code and not a compiled project where
	we would have more control over where support files are stored on the 
	machine	we have tried our best to create relative file paths back to
	files in our projects source folder.
	If these relative paths give you issues try setting them to static
	paths.

	File paths can be found in:
	manageRegistrationControl.cpp - lines 22-24
	storage.cpp - lines 16-18

	NOTE: For D2, we realized that our realtive file paths failed due to 
		how the project was compressed into the *.tar file.
